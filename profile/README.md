### Chris Ohk -- @utilForever

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Chris Ohk. I'm currently working as an engine engineer at Momenti. I'm working on creating a Rust-based core engine and distributing / deploying it for use on cross-platforms such as iOS, Android and the web. I previously developed game contents and C++-based game physics engine for Mabinogi: Heroes at Nexon Korea.

I'm interested in various topics, so I'm developing various side projects in my spare time.
* RosettaStone: Hearthstone simulator using C++ with some reinforcement learning
* CubbyFlow: Voxel-based fluid simulation engine for computer games
* CubbyTower: Simple tower defense game using C++ with Entity Component System (ECS)

Also, I'm the representative of C++ Korea, a C++ user group for Korea and Microsoft Developer Technologies MVP.
